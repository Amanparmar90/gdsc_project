        <h2 >What Is Web Development?</h2><br>
        <p>So, you’re interested in becoming a developer? Congratulations, and welcome to your new career! As you’ve started looking into different developer career paths, you’ve probably come across web development.

            But what is web development exactly? Why is it important, and what kinds of Web Developers are there?
            
            In a few words, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. By “website,” we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet, such as:
            
            The Codecademy website
            A closed, private network, such as your company or school intranet website.
            Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.
            
            In this article, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know about the basics of web development, including:
            
            Front-end vs. back-end web development
            The web development process
            Web development teams and roles
            Web development resources and tools
            Why web development is important
            Ready to start your new career in web development?</p><br>
            <h2>Front-end vs. back-end web development</h2><br>
            <p>Even if you’re new to web development, you’ve probably heard the terms “front-end development” and “back-end development” before. But what do they mean?

                Front-end web development has to do with the interface that you, the user, interact with when you visit a website or use a web application. Front-End Developers create everything you see on a web page, including:
                
                Colors
                Layout
                Navigation
                Back-end web development has to do with the parts of a website that you can’t see, particularly how website information is stored and retrieved.
                
                When you access a webpage in your browser, you’re essentially requesting to see a file stored on a server somewhere. When you load a webpage for the first time or sign into a website with a username and password, it’s Back-End Developers who make it possible to access website information efficiently and securely.
                
                Now that you understand the basics of web development, let’s look at how a website or web application comes to life from two perspectives: the web development process and the web development team.</p><br>
                <h2>Front-End Developer</h2><br>
                <p>The front end includes everything a user sees or interacts with, from drop-down menus to background colors and font text. This is also known as the client-side.

                    The principal coding tools of the Front-End Developer are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Still, many Front-End Developers are familiar with several other programming languages, frameworks, and libraries, including:
                    
                    Go
                    Java
                    Ruby
                    jQuery and SQL
                    React
                    Flask and Django
                    In short, Front-End Developers are responsible for ensuring that websites and web applications look great and work well, whether you’re using them on a phone, laptop, Mac, PC, or any browser.</p><br>
                    <h2>Back-End Developer</h2><br>
                    <p>Would you move into a beautiful house if you discovered it lacked electricity, internet, or running water? While Web Designers and Front-End Developers are responsible for the look and feel of a website or web application, Back-End Developers make sure that the website is connected correctly and that you can get the information you need from the site and its servers.

For example, when you clicked on the link to read this article, it’s because of Back-End Developers that your browser could request the article’s content, retrieve the information from our website servers, and quickly load it onto your laptop or device. This is also known as the server-side.

Back-End Developers often work with servers and databases, which means their technical skill sets include programming languages like:

PHP
Java
Node.js
SQL
Ruby
C#
</p><br>
<h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2><br>
<p>Full-Stack Developers are, for lack of a better phrase, the full package. They combine the skills of Front-End Developers and Back-End Developers. That means they can take part in developing the client-side or server-side of a web development project.

    A Full-Stack Developer may work on both sides of web development on smaller projects, or they may focus on one side or another on a larger project. They may also be assigned to do other tasks that take advantage of their full skill set, such as:
    
    Testing and debugging
    Optimizing compatibility across multiple browsers and devices (a.k.a. cross-platform compatibility)
    Developing APIs
    Considering security and scalability during the web development process</p>
